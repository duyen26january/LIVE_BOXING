.....Nguyen Huu Duyen is a person working in the fields of Chemistry - Electricity - and information technology.
Graduated from Vocational College No. 8 Bien Hoa, practical intellectual training environment at Vocational College No. 8 Ministry of National Defense
Serious self-study and research is the secret to all success in life
At that time, many problems regarding information technology were raised
-How to make the IF THEN commands work together without recursion

I said we can use the 3 node in way algorithm. We create a struct structure
consists of n nodes connected together and evaluated from 1-n, choosing a root node and moving the pieces on the nodes is then performing complex algorithms without using mainframes or supercomputers. count for what? Since then AI technology has become very popular.
Another thing is that computer chips made from SILICON are very expensive to produce because pure crystalline silicon doped with P and N is very expensive. To make hardware information technology cheaper, I As an excellent 9th grade student, there is no other way for me to research the semiconductor NaKTiC and SiTiC by synthesizing in an inertial moment environment as a method to create NaNo carbon...
In general, intellectual products are closed source products and copyrighted products. Why is that, we know that human history is created by certain costs, in order to be worthy of the labor of those who work, we must pay those who work, then we can feel that living and working is new. precious.
